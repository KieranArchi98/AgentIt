1. Frontend Architecture (React + TypeScript)
The frontend is built using a modern React stack with several key layers:
- Root Layout (with shared navigation and sidebar)
- Home Page (dashboard)
- Forums Page (category listing)
- Discussion Page (individual threads)
- Members Page (user directory)
- Settings Page (user preferences)
- Profile Page (user profiles)

Component Architecture:
UI Components (src/components/ui/):
Reusable, atomic components (Button, Input, Avatar)
Built using Radix UI primitives for accessibility
Styled with Tailwind CSS for consistent design
Layout Components (src/components/):
Navigation (top bar with search and user controls)
Sidebar (categories and quick links)
Layout (page structure and composition)

State Management:
React's built-in hooks for local state
Context for shared state (user authentication, themes)
Form handling with controlled components

Styling System:
Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
Custom utility functions (cn) for class merging
Responsive design patterns
Consistent color schemes and spacing

2. Backend Architecture (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
API Layer (packages/backend/src/):
- Controllers (route handlers)
- Models (database schemas)
- Services (business logic)
- Database (connection and queries)

Database Structure:
forums
  - id (primary key)
  - name
  - description
  - created_at
  - updated_at

posts
  - id (UUID)
  - title
  - content
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - forum_id (foreign key)
  - votes
  - created_at
  - updated_at

comments
  - id (UUID)
  - content
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - post_id (foreign key)
  - parent_id (self-referential)
  - created_at

profiles
  - id (UUID)
  - username
  - avatar_url
  - created_at
  - updated_at

votes
  - id (UUID)
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - post_id (foreign key)
  - vote_type (up/down)
  - created_at

Authentication & Authorization:
JWT-based authentication
Role-based access control
Secure session management

3. Key Technologies and Their Roles
Frontend:
React: UI library for component-based development
TypeScript: Static typing and better developer experience
Vite: Fast development server and build tool
Radix UI: Accessible component primitives
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling
React Router: Client-side routing
Lucide Icons: Modern icon system

Backend:
FastAPI: Modern, fast Python web framework
SQLAlchemy: SQL toolkit and ORM
PostgreSQL: Relational database
Pydantic: Data validation and settings management
asyncpg: Asynchronous PostgreSQL driver

4. Data Flow and Interactions
Request Flow

User Action → React Component → API Call → FastAPI Controller → 
Database Operation → Response → State Update → UI Update

Real-time Features:
Post updates
Vote counting
User presence
Notifications

Development Tools and Configuration
// vite.config.ts
{
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  }
}

// tsconfig.json
{
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./src/*"]
  }
}

Backend Configuration:
# settings.py
DATABASE_URL: str
CORS_ORIGINS: List[str]
JWT_SECRET: str
JWT_ALGORITHM: str
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: int
