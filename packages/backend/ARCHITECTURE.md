# Backend Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The backend is built using FastAPI and follows a modular, scalable architecture with API versioning. This document outlines the structure and key components of the backend.

## Directory Structure

```

## API Versioning

The API uses URL-based versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/users`). This allows us to:
- Make breaking changes while maintaining backward compatibility
- Support multiple API versions simultaneously
- Gradually deprecate old versions
- Migrate clients to new versions without disruption

## Key Components

### API Endpoints
- Located in `api/v{version}/endpoints/`
- Each module handles a specific resource (users, posts, etc.)
- Uses FastAPI dependency injection for clean, testable code

### Services
- Located in `services/`
- Implements business logic
- Interacts with database models and external services
- Maintains separation of concerns

### Third-Party Services
- Located in `third_party/`
- Encapsulates external service integrations
- Provides clean interfaces for the rest of the application
- Examples: email service, payment processing, etc.

### Utilities and Scripts
- Located in `utils/` and `scripts/`
- Common helper functions
- Database maintenance scripts
- Data migration tools
- Backup utilities

## Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Middleware for token validation
- Protected routes using FastAPI dependencies

## Documentation

- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation available at `/docs`
- ReDoc alternative at `/redoc`
- Includes:
  - Endpoint descriptions
  - Request/response schemas
  - Authentication requirements
  - Example requests and responses

## Error Handling

- Consistent error response format
- HTTP status codes follow REST conventions
- Detailed error messages in development
- Sanitized error messages in production

## Database

- PostgreSQL database
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Alembic for migrations
- Connection pooling for scalability

## Environment Configuration

- Uses python-dotenv for environment variables
- Different configurations for development/staging/production
- Sensitive values stored in environment variables

## Testing

- PyTest for unit and integration tests
- Separate test database
- Mock external services in tests
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Deployment

- Docker containerization
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health check endpoints
- Logging and monitoring setup

## Security Considerations

- Input validation using Pydantic models
- SQL injection prevention through ORM
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Security headers

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Use dependency injection
   - Keep functions small and focused

2. **Error Handling**
   - Use custom exception classes
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors appropriately

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep API documentation up to date
   - Document complex business logic
   - Include examples in docstrings

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Use fixtures for common test data

5. **Performance**
   - Use async/await for I/O operations
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Optimize database queries

## Future Considerations

- GraphQL API support
- WebSocket integration
- Caching layer
- Message queue integration
- Service mesh implementation
